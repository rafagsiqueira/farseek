# Initializing Working Directories

Farseek expects to be invoked from a working directory that contains
configuration files written in
[the Farseek language](../../language/index.mdx). Farseek uses
configuration content from this directory, and also uses the directory to store
settings, cached plugins and modules.

A working directory must be initialized before Farseek can perform any
operations in it (like provisioning infrastructure or modifying state).

## Working Directory Contents

A Farseek working directory typically contains:

- A Farseek configuration describing resources Farseek should manage. This
  configuration is expected to change over time.
- A hidden `.farseek` directory, which Farseek uses to manage cached
  provider plugins and modules. This directory is automatically managed by Farseek, and is
  created during initialization.

## Initialization

Run the `farseek init` command to initialize a working directory that contains
a Farseek configuration. After initialization, you will be able to perform
other commands, like `farseek plan` and `farseek apply`.

If you try to run a command that relies on initialization without first
initializing, the command will fail with an error and explain that you need to
run init.

Initialization performs several tasks to prepare a directory, including downloading and installing provider
plugins, and downloading modules.

For details, see [the `farseek init` command](../../cli/commands/init.mdx).

## Reinitialization

Certain types of changes to a Farseek configuration can require
reinitialization before normal operations can continue. This includes changes to
provider requirements, module sources or version constraints.

You can reinitialize a directory by running `farseek init` again. In fact, you
can reinitialize at any time; the init command is idempotent, and will have no
effect if no changes are required.

If reinitialization is required, any commands that rely on initialization will
fail with an error and tell you so.

## Reinitializing Only Modules

The `farseek get` command will download modules referenced in the
configuration, but will not perform the other required initialization tasks.
This command is only useful for niche workflows, and most Farseek users can
ignore it in favor of `farseek init`.
